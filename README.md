# Overview

This program is a small game where you navigate between rooms by inputing the direction you want to go. I wrote it to practice with C# classes and how to build up a map using them. Each room is a class and all the rooms are stored in a Map class where they can be accessed using "getters" to get their name and description to display for the player.
I had a bit of experience in C# already, but this helped me remmeber a lot fo the important parts of class construction and how to do things like inheritance between classes.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
